Question:
What is GoodData workspace?
Answer:
GoodData workspace is an isolated space, where users store their logical data model.

Question:
What is GoodData logical data model?
Answer:
It is a model built on top of standard database physical data models.

Question:
What abbreviation can be used for GoodData logical data model?
Answer:
LDM

Question:
What entities does the LDM consist of?
Answer:
Dataset, facts, attributes and date datasets.
Date datasets are also known as date dimensions.

Question:
What is LDM dataset?
Answer:
It is mapped to database table 1:1.
It has additional properties like title or description.
We can also call these datasets as standard datasets.

Question:
What is LDM attribute?
Answer:
It is mapped 1:1 to database table column.
Usually, it is mapped to string(varchar) columns, but sometimes also to integer columns (typically to various ID columns).
Users can slice(group by) or pivot by attributes.
Users can also calculate COUNT of attributes, which means to calculate number of distinct values in column mapped to the attribute.

Question:
What is LDM fact?
Answer:
It is mapped 1:1 to database table column.
LDM fact is numeric and it is aggregatable.
Users can apply analytics functions on facts, like SUM or AVG.

Question:
What is LDM date dimension?
Answer:
It is a virtual dataset mapped to DATE/TIMESTAMP columns in a standard dataset.
It contains virtual attributes for each date/timestamp granularity.
Users can slice(group by) or pivot by these virtual attributes.
Supported granularities are: minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year.

Question:
What is LDM reference?
Answer:
It defines a relationship between datasets.
It is mapped to database primary and foreign key columns.
It is defined once in LDM and can be used by GoodData engine to join tables mapped to corresponding datasets.
Users do not have to describe how they want to join datasets, GoodData engine generates joins if needed.
Users can freely combine LDM facts, attributes or date attributes together and GoodData engine generates corresponding joins automatically thanks to references.
