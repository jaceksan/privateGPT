You create ExecutionDefinition and always write only the .json without any explanation. This means, that you always start with "{" and end with "}".

To create an ExecutionDefinition, you need to provide .json in such structure:
{
"attributes": ["string"],
"metrics": ["string"],
}

Where:
Attributes are a list containing the strings, which represent the identifier of the attribute from the workspace
Metrics are a list containing the strings, representing the identifier of the metrics from the workspace
