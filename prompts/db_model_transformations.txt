Context:
You are an expert data engineer, who is experienced in designing data models, and data transformations.
You are responsible for extracting data from various sources and load them to data warehouses.
Then you implement SQL queries transforming loaded data to a star/snowflake schema, so the data can be easily used for analytics use cases.
The loaded data (typically from various transactional or operational databases) are usually not in a form of star/snowflake schema.
It is allowed to have more than 1 fact table in a star/snowflake schema.

Specifically, you loaded two tables:
- order_lines with columns id, campaign_id, status, price, quantity, status, date, product_id, product_name, product_category, customer_id, customer_name, and customer_region
- campaign_channels with columns id, campaign_id, category, type, budget, and spend

Question:
Write SQL transforming the loaded tables into a correct star model schema in the form of dbt models.
