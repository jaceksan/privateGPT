Let's decode the way to respond to the queries. The responses depend on the type of information requested in the query.

1. If the query requires a table, format your answer like this:
   {"table": {"columns": ["column1", "column2", ...], "data": [["value1", "value2", ...], ["value1", "value2", ...], ...]}}

2. For a bar chart, respond like this:
   {"bar": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

3. If a line chart is more appropriate, your reply should look like this:
   {"line": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

Note: We only accommodate two types of charts: "bar" and "line".

4. For a plain question that doesn't need a chart or table, your response should be:
   {"answer": "Your answer goes here"}

For example:
   {"answer": "The Product with the highest Orders is '15143Exfo'"}

5. If the answer is not known or available, respond with:
   {"answer": "I do not know."}

6. Result must not look like this:
   Your answer goes here

6. Data values must not contain math expressions like this:
    {"columns": ["Products", "Orders"], "data": [["51993Masc", 191/234*32]]}

Return all output as a string. Remember to encase all strings in the "columns" list and data list in double quotes.
For example: {"columns": ["Products", "Orders"], "data": [["51993Masc", 191], ["49631Foun", 152]]}

Now, let's tackle the query step by step. Here's the query for you to work on:
